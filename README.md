# 2022-2023-Football-Stats-EDA



## Project Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the 2022-23 football season statistics. The dataset contains detailed team performance data from various leagues, focusing on metrics such as goals scored, goals against, expected goals (xG), expected goals against (xGA), and more. The aim is to uncover trends and insights into team performances, top scorers, and defensive metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on 98 football teams with 20 features, including:
- **Squad**: Team name
- **Country**: Country of the league
- **MP**: Matches played
- **W/D/L**: Wins, draws, and losses
- **GF/GA/GD**: Goals for, goals against, and goal difference
- **Pts**: Points
- **xG/xGA/xGD**: Expected goals, expected goals against, and expected goal difference
- **Attendance**: Average attendance
- **Top Team Scorer**: The team's top scorer and their goal count
- **Goalkeeper**: The team's main goalkeeper


## Usage

The notebook contains steps to load, clean, and analyze the football statistics data.

Key analyses in the notebook include:
- **Team performance comparison** (wins, goals, etc.)
- **Correlation analysis** between expected goals (xG) and actual goals scored
- **Visualizations** of top scorers, defensive records, and attendance trends

## Visualizations

The project uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create visualizations such as:
- **Bar plots** of team performance (wins, goals)
- **Scatter plots** comparing xG and actual goals
- **Heatmaps** to analyze correlations between different metrics

## Features

- **Team Performance Analysis**: Overview of wins, goals, and defensive stats.
- **Expected Goals (xG) Analysis**: Comparison between expected and actual performance.
- **Attendance Insights**: Analysis of crowd attendance and its relation to team performance.
- **Top Scorers**: Highlights the top scorers for each team.
